To recapitulate what I believe to have been the correct se? quence of events ... Here the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty are known to have built a forti? fied city (2oth century BC.) The autobiography of Sinuhi, a court official who fled from Egypt to Palestine during the last days of Amenemhat I, the first king of the Twelfth Dynasty (1970 BC) , mentions his passing the border fortress, which at that time bore the name 'Ways of Horus'. The border city was rebuilt and refortified by the Asiatic Hyksos rulers who took control of Egypt for just over a century from the mid-seventeenth century BC. During this period it became known as Avaris. Later, when the kings of the Eighteenth Dynasty expelled the Hyksos, they in turn re? built the city with new fortifications, it was given the new name of Zarw and it became the main outpost on the Asiatic frontier, the point at which Egyptian armies began and ended their campaigns against Palestine/ Syria. During the time ofTuthmosis IV (1413-1405 BC), his queen had an es? tate and residence within Zarw. Subsequently, Amenhotep III, the son of Tuthmosis IV, gave this royal residence, Zarw-kha, within the walls of Zarw, to his wife, Queen Tiye, as a present. I explained this event as stemming from the king's desire to allow Tiye to have a summer resi? dence in the area of nearby Goshen in the Eastern Delta where her fa? ther's Israelite family had been allowed to settle. (I regard Yuya, Queen Tiye's father, as being the Patriarch Joseph, of the coat of many colours, who brought the tribe of Israel from Canaan to dwell in Egypt.) Later still, after the fall of the Amarna kings, who were descendants of both Amenhotep III and Yuya, Horemheb, the king who succeeded them, deprived the Israelites of their special position at Goshen and turned their city of Zarw into a prison. There he appointed Pa-Ramses and his son, Seti, as viziers and mayors of Zarw as well as commanders of the fortress and its troops. Pa-Ramses, the new mayor of the city, forced the Israelites into harsh labour, building for him what the Book of Exodus describes as a 'store city' within the walls of Zarw. Pa-Ramses fol? lowed Horemheb on the throne as Ramses I in 1335 BC, establishing the Nineteenth Dynasty, and it was during his brief reign, lasting little more than a year, that Moses led the Israelites out of the Eastern Delta into Sinai. At the time he came to the throne, Ramses I already had his residence at Zarw, being the city's mayor. His son, Seti I, and the latter's son, Ram? ses II, later established a new royal residence at Zarw that became known as Pi-Ramses and was used as the Delta capital of the Ramesside kings of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties for about two centuries. The kings of the Twenty-first Dynasty established a new residence at Tanis, south of Lake Menzalah, and made use in its construction of many monuments and much stone from Pi-Ramses, which misled later scribes into the erroneous belief that Pi-Ramses and Tanis were identical loca? tions. The whole issue of whether or not Pi-RamsesJAvaris and Zarw are to be found at the same location has been clouded by the fact that, while we know the precise location of Zarw, scholars have in the course ofthis cen? tury canvassed the claims of no fewer than six other sites in the Eastern Delta, in addition to Tanis, as the location of Pi-RamsesjAvaris, and two alternative sites - one at Thebes, the other in Middle Egypt - as the site of Tiye's city. The Delta sites have been advanced even if they failed to yield the required archaeological evidence, were in the wrong nome and, in some cases, did not exist at the relevant time. Each was abandoned in turn to be replaced by a seventh site, QantirjTell el-Dab'a. Investigations at Tell el-Dab'a, just over a mile south of Qantir (one of the sites sug? gested earlier, and now revived) , were begun by the University of Vienna and the Austrian Archaeological Institute in 1966 and are still contin- ut� ng. This location has achieved considerable acceptance as the site of Pi-Ramses1Avaris since Manfred Bietak, the Austrian Egyptologist in charge of the excavations, gave an interim report on the expedition's find? ings in 1979. Yet this site, too, does not withstand close scrutiny any more than the previous six in the Eastern Delta that had been put for? ward. Recent archaeological discoveries in the Kantarah area make it unnecessary to argue at this point the objections to the QantirjTell el? Dab'a location, which can be found in Appendix D: instead I am concen? trating here on some ofthe mass of evidence that Pi-RamsesjAvaris is to be found on the same site as Zarw. From written sources we know that: � Pi-Ramses was situated in a fertile wine-producing area and lay in the centre of a great vineyard: Zarw was in a wine-producing area, which is supported by two pieces of evidence. Remains of wine jars, sent from Zarw by its then mayor Djehutymes for celebrations of Amenhotep III's first jubilee in his Year 30, were found in the Malkata palace complex at Western Thebes,3 and a wine jar from the house of Aten at Zarw, belong? ing to his Year 5, was found in the tomb ofTutankhamun; � Pi-Ramses was 'the forefront of every foreign land, the end of Egypt', located 'between Palestine and Egypt':4 Zarw had an identical location, at the starting point of the 'road of Horus', leading to Palestine; � Pi-Ramses could be reached by water from Memphis: Zarw could be reached by water from Memphis; � Pi-Ramses was connected by water with the fortress of Zarw and the Waters of Shi-hor (north and north-west of Zarw), which fits exactly what we know of the Ramesside Delta residence; � Pi-Ramses was supplied with papyrus by the Waters of Pa-Twfy, 'The Sea Of Reeds', which has been identified with Lake Ballah, to the south of Zarw; � Pi-Ramses' boundaries were marked by some of its chief temples, with Seth the main deity worshipped there: 'Its western part is the house of Amun, its southern part the house of Seth, Astarte is in its Orient, and Buto in its northern part': s Seth was also the main deity worshipped at Zarw; � An indication that Pi-Ramses was built originally as a royal residence within the walls of Zarw is to be found in the name Pi-Ramses itself In? stead of a usual determinative for a city, a cross inside a circle, we have a sign for a house, Pi (Pr) preceding the name. This term Pr is usually ap? plied either to a temple area, a religious area or a walled area containing a royal palace as well as a temple and other administrative buildings. � Pi- Ramses was located in the fourteenth Egyptian nome and to the east ofthe Pelusiac branch of the Nile Delta: so was Zarw; � Pi-Ramses had strong military fortifications, and, according to Manetho, as quoted by Josephus, Avaris, which was on the same site, was very favourably situated, well-fortified and in a strategic military position: this was equally true of Zarw. Abundant evidence exists to confirm that Pi-Ramses was heavily forti? fied. A stela at Abu Simbel of the thirty-fifth year of Ramses II has the god Ptah telling the king: 'I have made for thee a noble Residence in or? der to strengthen the boundary of the Two Lands, House of Ramses, Beloved of Amun,' thus confirming that the residence was both fortified and near the borders. Gardiner has pointed out that the special epithets attached to the city's name indicate its location near the border: '... two epithets [are] frequently ... added to the cartouche and its adjuncts; these, according to the habit of Egyptian names, express the precise aspect in which the king appears in the particular locality that they designate, and are the real distinguishing marks by which that locality could be differ? entiated from others owing their names to the same king. The original name of the city in its complete form was ... The House of Ramses, Beloved ofAmun, Great ofVictories, and the boastful addition here made to the royal nomen conveys a significant hint as to the position of the city near the military road to Asia.'6 Another indication that Pi-Ramses was designated as being a 'mighty place' is provided in Ramses II's inscription at his father's temple in Aby? dos, while Papyrus Anastasi III describes Pi-Ramses as being 'the mar? shalling place of thy [Pharaoh's] cavalry, the rallying point of thy soldiers, the harbourage of thy ships' troops ... ' All the sources we have about Avaris confirm - as one would expect if it is the same place - that, like Pi-Ramses, it was a fortified city. The Egyptian name of Avaris consists of two elements, hwt-w'ret, which are followed by a determinative, not of a city but of a walled area. The first element, hwt, indicates a settlement surrounded by a high brick wall, the second element, w'ret, as Alan Gardiner has explained, signifies a 'desert strip'. So the very name of the city indicates that it was both fortified and near the desert border, just as Zarw was. This was precisely what one would expect in the case of Asiatic invaders in order both to protect them? selves against the natives and be near their escape road to Asia. The ac? count of Manetho, as quoted by Josephus, agrees with this under? standing: ' In the Saite [Sethroite fourteenth nome], he [the Hyksos ruler] founded a city very favourably situated on the east of the Bubastite branch of the Nile [the north section of the Pelusiac], and called Avaris af? ter an ancient religious tradition. This place he rebuilt and fortified with massive walls, planting a garrison ... to guard the frontier. Here he would come in summertime, partly to train them carefully in manoeuvres and to strike terror into foreign tribes ... '7 This also agrees with the descrip? tion of Avaris as a walled settlement in the Kamose Stela, which gives an account of campaigns against the Hyksos invaders by the brother of King Ahmosis, founder of the Eighteenth Dynasty, and the autobiography of Ahmose, a naval officer, who also took part in the war of liberation and describes in his tomb at el-Kab in Nubia how 'they [the Egyptian army] sat down [in siege] before the town of Avaris'.8 � Pi-Ramses was also called 'The Dwelling of the Lion' : Zarw agrees with descriptions of Pi-Ramses in the fact that it is connected both with Horus and the lion: according to the text in Papyrus Anastasi,9 Horus took the form ofa lion at Zarw and a seated lion forms the second part of the city's name; � Exodus r3:r7 indicates that the city of Ramses was near 'the way of the land of the Philistines', known from Egyptian sources as the 'road of Ho? rus', leading from Zarw to Gaza; � The triumphal Poem of Pe-natour, recording the victories of Ramses II in his Year 5, and a letter describing the delivery of some stele identify Pi? Ramses and Zarw as being in the same vicinity, and the account of Seti I's return from his Year I campaign against the Shasu in Sinai indicated that the royal family had a residence in the area from the early days of the Nineteenth Dynasty; � A reference was made in Papyrus Anastasi (vol. 24, pp. 7, 8) to 'the fortress of Ramses, which is in Zarw', indicating that the fortress of Zarw was sometimes referred to as 'the fortress of Ramses, myr Amun': this could also have been the case regarding the city; � A channel through the Isthmus of Kantarah was first noticed by Napoleon's French expedition of 1798-I8o1. This channel was called the 'separating water' (ta-dynt in Egyptian) , and is the canal represented on Seti I's war inscriptions in the Hypostyle Hall at Karnak. It connected Shi-Hor to the north and north-west with the Waters of Pa-Twfy in the south, and separated Zarw from the Eastern Delta. Access to the fortress was provided by a bridge, which became the origin of the modern name, Kantarah (bridge). This mass of circumstantial evidence, which is by no means exhaustive, served to persuade some scholars that Avaris, Pi-Ramses and Zarw occu? pied one and the same location: 'Dr Gardiner has told us that Ramses, the capital, and Avaris are the same place. The question is therefore: where was Avaris? I have no hesitation in agreeing with M. (Jean) Cledat, (the French Egyptologist), that it was the region and the city called Zarw, the present Kantarah, and its neighbourhood.'to Yet very few accepted this identification when it was first put forward by Cledat in Basically it was the lack of archaeological evidence that caused the failure of scholars to give proper attention to Cledat's views for, although he was correct in identifying Pi-RamsesjAvaris and Zarw as occupying the same location in the Kantarah area, he was wrong in identifying the precise spot as Tell Abu-Seifah, just over a mile south-east of modern Kantarah, where only monuments of a late Graeco-Roman period were discovered. This error stemmed fundamentally from the assumption that the starting point of the ancient 'road of Horus' was the same as that of the modern road leading from the Kantarah area to Gaza. The fact that the ancient 'road of Horus' began elsewhere became clear when Mohammad Abdel Maqsoud, a senior excavations officer with the Egyptian Antiquity Organization, began to supervise diggings at Tell Heboua, some two-and-a-half miles north-east of Kantarah, three years ago. From the war reliefs of Seti I at Karnak we know the names of dif? ferent guarded military posts between Zarw and Gaza, the first of which, from the Egyptian side, is called the 'Dwelling of the Lion'. After two sea? sons of excavation, Maqsoud gave an account of his findings to members of the Fifth International Congress of Egyptology in Cairo in November 1988, concluding his speech with the words: 'It is possible now to iden? tify the fortress of Tell Heboua with the "Dwelling of the Lion" depicted in the reliefs of Seti I at Karnak.' Maqsoud released some details of his findings at the end of the third season, and on reading them in an Egyptian newspaper in April 1989 I realized that, without being aware of it, he had found the location of Pi-RamsesjAvarisjZarw, a view which was published by the Sunday Times of London a month later and has since become the subject of discussion by Egyptologists all over the world. What, in fact, had Maq? soud discovered? The site of Tell Heboua proved to be near the ancient Pelusiac branch of the Nile, between two lakes - north and south - on the western side of which are indications of an ancient canal, and it is at the start of what has now been established as the 'road of Horus'. Remains of massive forti? fying walls, more than thirteen feet wide, enclose a square area of some r9o,ooo square yards. Inside the walls are the remains of at least two an? cient towns - one Hyksos, the other dating from the Eighteenth Dynasty - with houses, streets, storehouses, bread and clay ovens, and burials of two different kinds on two levels. Maqsoud also found four identical ste? lae of Nehesy, the king of the weak Thirteenth Dynasty, two of which bear his cartouche. It was Nehesy (c. 1715 BC) who re-established Seth as the main deity of the fourteenth nome. Seth had earlier been discredited as a result of development of the myth that he had been responsible for the assassination of the good god Osiris. There was also a fragment of an architrave, belonging to a temple, with a cartouche of Seti I. Although much of the site has not yet been excavated, scarabs and oth? er small items found there point to the existence of temples and palaces. Skeletal remains of children also make it clear that this was not simply a fortress but also a non-military settlement during both the Hyksos and Empire periods. In addition, Maqsoud even found remains of an Asiatic community that had occupied the site before construction of the forti? fying walls in the Hyksos period, indicating that the site had been occu? pied by a Canaanite community during the Thirteenth Dynasty which preceded Hyksos rule in the Eastern Delta. The most important evidence, however, is provided by the fortifi? cations themselves. This is the only fortified city ever to have been found in the Eastern Delta. Moreover, it has at least three different walls at three levels, confirming what we know from literary sources of Pi-Ramsesj AvarisJZarw. Dr Eric Uphill, Hon. Research Fellow of Egyptology at University Col? lege, London, has accepted in a discussion at the Egyptian Cultural Cen? tre that the city at Tell Heboua could be identified with Zarw, and even Maqsoud himself has changed the subject of the PhD thesis he is preparing at Lille University in France from having found the 'Dwelling of the Lion', accepting that what he has actually found is the fortified city of Zarw. I think that before long others will come to the same conclusion regarding the remains of the upper strata. The next question that will have to be faced is: what about the fortified Hyksos city beneath Zarw? The textual information we have not only in? forms us that Avaris was fortified, but that it was the only fortified Hyk? sos city in Egypt - and none of the other locations suggested hitherto for the Hyksos capital so far reveals any kind of fortifications. Archaeological work in Syria/Palestine has brought to light a number of Hyksos cities, all of which were almost identical. They featured a characteristic system of fortification whose most dominant feature was the use of glacis, a steeply-sloping inner wall of plastered limestone, encircling the sides of an ancient mound on which the city was built; a heavy retaining wall of battered stone at the foot of the inner wall, and a large city wall around the summit. In defence of the site of QantirJTell el? Dab'a being the location of Pi-Ramses, it has been suggested that the lack of massive walls and fortifications, which are essential evidence for such an identification, is to be explained by the fact that they were long ago washed away by the waters of the Nile: yet, if this were the case, one is entitled to ask how ordinary houses, much less strongly built, have man? aged to survive in the same layers and under the same conditions? In the meantime, as the walled city of Zarw found by Maqsoud lies on top of a mound, it seems likely that the walls of Avaris lie beneath it; and Dr Ali Hassan, the head of the Egyptian Antiquity Organization, has admitted: 'The remains found beneath the city are the first Hyksos re? mains to be found in Sinai and raise a new doubt regarding the position - now generally accepted as Tell el-Dab'a - of the Hyksos capital in Egypt.' As there is complete agreement among scholars that the finding of Avaris would also mean having located Pi- Ramses, I do not think we are too far from establishing the truth now that both of those cities are lo? cated at Tell Heboua, particularly when the site yields further evidence in the planned fourth season of excavation. Tiye's City As the final part of the word Zarw-kha has the determinative of a city - a circle including a cross - some early Egyptologists, such as Petrie, Maspero and Cledat, having removed this final part of the name, iden? tified Tiye's city, Zarw-kha, with the border fortress and city In addition, Cledat demonstratedt3 that Lake Ballah, to the south of Kan? tarah, is the pleasure lake mentioned in the scarab. As Zarw was the fron? tier city on the road to Asia, the use of the epithet 'who smites the Asi? atics' in the scarab again points to Zarw as the location of Tiye's city. More recently, however, two alternative sites - distant from the frontier - have been canvassed as Tiye's city (see Appendix D). 12 AI<H ENATEN: THE EARLY YEARS THE early marriage between Amenhotep III and Tiye, the parents of Akhenaten, is attested by an issue of scarabs dated to Year 2 of his reign. Although we know of female descendants of this marriage, not much evi? dence survives about the birth and childhood of Amenhotep IV (Akhen? aten) . It seems, however, that he had an elder brother, Tuthmosis, who died before Akhenaten was born. Tuthmosis, we know, was being edu? cated and trained at Memphis and held the title of the High Priest of Ptah, as did most heirs-apparent during the Eighteenth Dynasty, but then he disappeared suddenly from the scene. Some additional light was cast on the youth of Akhenaten as a result of excavations on the site of Amenhotep III's royal palace complex at Malkata in Western Thebes by the discovery of hundreds of small in? scribed fragments of great historical importance. Here it becomes evident that the Middle Palace of the complex was probably built for Akhenaten while he was still a prince and, as 'Regnal Year V occurs in the inscrip? tions, that he continued to live there during the early Theban years of the coregency with his father. The earliest dating for Amenhotep III is not earlier than Year 8, which indicates that Year r could not relate to him. The only mention of Akhenaten before his accession to the throne was found in Malkata in the form of an undated wine-jar seal with the inscription '... (of) the estate of the true King's Son, Amenhotep (Akhen? aten) '. The use ofthe expression 'true son' indicates an early challenge to the prince's right to inherit the throne and that the coregency had not yet started. This therefore dates the wine-jar seal to some time between Year 20 of Amenhotep III, who spent most of his time in Memphis until then, and the start of the coregency in Year 28. It also suggests that at around this time Akhenaten was old enough to have his own establishment. It is, in fact, thought that he was in his mid-teens when the coregency started: 'His [Akhenaten's] brother, who ordinarily would have inherited the throne, had died in infancy, and Amenhotep IV was made coregent with his father ... He was perhaps sixteen years at the time.'l Deducting sixteen years from the start of the coregency with his father, we come to Year I2 of Amenhotep III as the year of his birth. Further? more, two commemorative scarabs issued by Amenhotep III point to the possible place of his birth. The first, dated to Year IO, relates 'a miracle, brought to His Majesty, the daughter of the prince of Nahrin [Mitanni], Sutarna [Tushratta's father], Gilukhipa and persons of her harem, 3I7 women'. The last issue of these commemorative scarabs is the pleasure lake scarab, dated to Year II and, as we saw earlier, recording '... under the majesty of ... Amenhotep III, given life; and the Great King's Wife Tiye, in her city of Zarw-kha ... His Majesty celebrated the feast of the lake, in the third month of the first season, day I6, when His Majesty sailed thereon in the royal barge Aten Gleams.' It seems that, after his first year with the Mitannian princess, Amen? hotep III went back to Queen Tiye for a kind of second honeymoon in her Eastern Delta city of Zarw - the 'end of Egypt', where the desert and the road to Gaza began, and close to Goshen where the Israelites had set? tled - which must have become the summer residence for the royal fam? ily, as it became again during the Ramesside rule of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties. The Egyptians had three seasons, Inundation, Win? ter and Gathering, each of four months, with the year beginning in mid? July. The middle of the third month would therefore have been around I October. Thus it is possible that Akhenaten was born in I394 BC, either towards the mid-July end ofYear II or around the beginning of year I2. Zarw had been rebuilt during the Eighteenth Dynasty as a conveniently situated military post for operations in Asia. It also seems that the harem of Tuthmosis IV, Amenhotep III's father, had a residence at Zarw as inscriptions of Neby, the city's vizier at the time, found at Sarabit el Khadim in Sinai, give his titles not only as 'Mayor of Zarw' and 'Troop Commander', but as 'Steward of the Harem of the Royal Wife'. If the queen in question was Mutimuya, Amenhotep's mother, this could imply that even Amenhotep III must have spent some time during his childhood in this Eastern Delta residence of his mother, especially at the height of summer when the Delta was cooler than Lower and Middle Egypt. Akhenaten was born in an era of peace and prosperity for Egypt. A combination of diplomacy, judicious marriages and equally judicious use of gold had secured a balance of power, at least temporarily, between Egypt and the neighbouring Hurrian State of Mitanni, the Hittites, the Assyrians and Babylonians; Palestine and Syria, conquered by Tuthmosis III in the middle of the fifteenth century BC, posed no threat; the south? ern frontier had been secured up to and beyond the Nile's Fourth Cataract. Luxuries from the Levant and the Aegean world poured into the country on a greater scale than ever before, more land was brought under cultivation, art flourished, prosperous State officials and priests enjoyed the pleasures of new town houses and country villas with large estates. How the common people fared is less clear, but they must have benefited from the general prosperity and the State projects that offered alternative employment during the long summer droughts. Throughout the country, new temples were founded, old ones restored. One of the biggest temporal projects was Amenhotep III's splendid palace, the Malkata, in western Thebes, opposite modern Luxor, with an imposing mortuary temple beside it for the god Amun-Re. Thebes was al? so the seat of the State god, Amun-Re. While ancient cults of other gods continued to flourish locally, the cult of Amun-Re had received, and continued to receive, such favourable royal treatment - generous endow? ment for the great temple of Karnak at Thebes, munificent gifts of land and gold - that it had become virtually an arm of the State executive. Yet there was already a hint in the air of the enormous religious upheaval that lay ahead. During the reign of Amenhotep II, the king's grandfather, and Tuth? mosis IV, his father, a gradual but growing fusion had taken place be? tween the cult of Amun, the patron god of the Eighteenth Dynasty, and the cult of Re, the sun-god, whose foremost centre of worship was far to the north at On (Heliopolis), north of modern Cairo and close to the important administrative and military capital of Memphis. Re was looked upon as the lord of the universe, the giver of all life, and the king ruled according to Re's divine plan by virtue ofbeing his son. On an increasing scale during this period hymns and prayers to Re as the giver of life be? gan to appear on a variety of monuments, including stelae and tomb doors. As a rule the name of the sun-god was given in the form common in Heliopolis, Re-Harakhti (Horus of the Horizon) . At a royal as well as a religious level a change took place during this pe? riod that must have seemed as strange to those aware of it as some of the wilder claims of today's ardent feminists. The name of Queen Tiye, un? like that of earlier queens, is placed regularly in a cartouche, a distinction previously limited to the ruling monarch, and is also included in royal titularies. Furthermore, she is represented as being of equivalent stature to the king. As with Moses, we know very little of Akhenaten's early years beyond the fact that he had an extremely close relationship with his mother, Queen Tiye, who seems to have been his only confidante at this stage of his life. There is no evidence that he spent his early days at Memphis, where his father had his main residence at the time and where the heirs apparent were normally trained and educated with the sons of the nobles. His appearance at Thebes does not seem to have occurred until Year 20 of his father, Amenhotep III, when the evidence of the wine-jar seal has been interpreted as 'the true king's son, Amenhotep', indicates that he had a palace there. William C. Hayes, the American Egyptologist, com? ments on this inscription: 'The King's son, Amenhotep, referred to here was in all probability the future king Amenhotep IV before his elevation to the coregency, which is thought to have taken place in or about Year 28 ofAmenhotep III.'2 It is from his behaviour and the kind of knowledge he seemed to have acquired at the time of his ultimate appearance at Thebes that we have to guess at where Akhenaten most probably passed the greater part of his childhood. His appearance does not suggest that he had any physical training, contrary to the custom among Eighteenth Dynasty kings, and he is never shown hunting lions or other wild animals. Nor is he depicted smiting an enemy or leading his army in combat. On the other hand he does not seem to have had the respect for Egyptian deities or customs evinced by other kings. As many elements of Akhenaten's new religion had their origin in the solar worship of Heliopolis, this points to his having had some training and education at this city, especially as Anen, the brother of Queen Tiye, was a high priest of Re, probably at Heliopolis. Yet his developed views about the Aten when he was still a young man suggest that he must have been involved in his early years in a monotheistic cult of the Aten at Zarw, his mother's city, which - if his life in early childhood, like that of Moses, had been under threat - would have been the safest place to con? ceal him. A significant pointer to the existence of such a cult there even before the birth of Akhenaten is the fact that the vessel used by Amenhotep III when he sailed on the pleasure lake was named Aten Gleams. We also have evidence that the Aten temples which Akhenaten built at both Karnak and Luxor at the beginning of his coregency were not the first At? en temples in Egypt, and, again significantly, the very first shrine appears to have been in the city of Zarw. Another of the titles of Neby, the mayor of Zarw during the time of Tuthmosis IV, was imyr hnt, and, as the word hnt has been interpreted as meaning 'lake' or 'lake area', Gun Bjorkman, the Swedish Egyptologist, has taken this title to indicate Neby's control over the lake area of Zarw: 'This seems to agree very well with what can be concluded from the monuments of Neby. Considering the nature of Zarw and its neighbourhood, it also seems suitable that Neby should have the designation discussed.' Bjorkman also gave a footnote reference on the same page. 'Professor Yoyotte has drawn my attention to a photo? graph in the Archives P. Lacau (Photo A III, 63, F6) of a talalat, i.e. a small block from the time of Akhenaten (these are the stones that Akhen? aten used in the building of his Theban temples), showing a procession of bowing officials. The accompanying inscriptions describe Neby as "The Overseer of the Foremost Water in the hnt of the Temple of Aten".'3 As this scene and inscription indicate a Temple of Aten already in exis?`

We do it every day. "You won't believe what happened at work." Or "Guess what I just did!" Or "A guy goes into a bar ..." We see, hear, read, and tell thousands of stories in our lives. The problem comes in telling a great story. If you want to become a master storyteller, and maybe even get paid to be one, you run up against tremendous obstacles. For one thing, showing the how and why of human life is a monumental job. You have to have a deep and precise understanding of the biggest, most complex subject there is. And then you have to be able to translate your understanding into a story. For most writers, that may be the biggest challenge of all. I want to be specific about the obstacles of story technique because that's the only way a writer can hope to overcome them. The first obstacle is the common terminology most writers use to think about story. Terms like "rising action," "climax," "progressive complication," and "denouement," terms that go as far back as Aristotle, are so broad and theoretical as to be almost meaningless. Let's be honest: they have no practical value for storytellers. Say you are writing a scene where your hero is hanging by his fingertips, seconds from falling to his death. Is that a progressive complication, a rising action, a denouement, or the opening scene of the story? It may be none of them or all of them, but in any event, these terms don't tell you how to write the scene or whether to write it at all. The classic story terms suggest an even bigger obstacle to good technique: the very idea of what story is and how it works. As a storyteller in training, the first thing you probably did was read Aristotle's Poetics. I believe Aristotle was the greatest philosopher in history. But his thinking about story, while powerful, is surprisingly narrow, focused on a limited number of plots and genres. It is also extremely theoretical and difficult to put into actual practice, which is why most storytellers trying to learn the practical techniques of their craft from Aristotle leave empty-handed. If you are a screenwriter, you probably moved from Aristotle to a much simpler understanding of story called "three-act structure." This is also problematic, because three-act structure, albeit a lot easier to understand than Aristotle, is hopelessly simplistic and in many ways just plain wrong. Three-act theory says that every story for the screen has three "acts": the first act is the beginning, the second is the middle, and the third is the end. The first act is about thirty pages long. The third act is also about thirty pages long. And the second act runs to around sixty pages. And this three-act story supposedly has two or three "plot points" (whatever those are). Got that? Great. Now go and write a professional script. I'm simplifying this theory of story, but not by much. It should be obvious that such an elementary approach has even less practical value than Aristotle. But what's worse is that it promotes a view of story that is mechanical. The idea of an act break comes from the conventions of traditional theater, where we close the curtain to signal the end of an act. We don't need to do that in movies, novels, and short stories or even, for that matter, in many contemporary plays. In short, act breaks are external to the story. Three-act structure is a mechanical device superimposed on the story and has nothing to do with its internal logic—where the story should or should not go. A mechanical view of story, like three-act theory, inevitably leads to episodic storytelling. An episodic story is a collection of pieces, like parts stored in a box. Events in the story stand out as discrete elements and don't connect or build steadily from beginning to end. The result is a story that moves the audience sporadically, if at all. Another obstacle to mastering storytelling has to do with the writing process. Just as many writers have a mechanical view of what a story is, they use a mechanical process for creating one. This is especially true of screenwriters whose mistaken notions of what makes a script salable lead them to write a script that is neither popular nor good. Screenwriters typically come up with a story idea that is a slight variation on a movie they saw six months previously. Then they apply a genre, like "detective," "love," or "action," and fill in the characters and plot beats (story events) that go with that form. The result: ahopelessly generic, formulaic story devoid of originality. In this book, I want to show you a better way. My goal is to explain how a great story works, along with the techniques needed to create one, so that you will have the best chance of writing a great story of your own. Some would argue that it's impossible to teach someone how to tell a great story. I believe it can be done, but it requires that we think and talk about story differently than in the past.`

So what makes each of them a story? What do all stories do? What is the storyteller both revealing to and hiding from the audience? KEY POINT: All stories are a form of communication that expresses the dramatic code. The dramatic code, embedded deep in the human psyche, is an artistic description of how a person can grow or evolve. This code is also a process going on underneath every story. The storyteller hides this process beneath particular characters and actions. But the code of growth is what the audience ultimately takes from a good story. Let's look at the dramatic code in its simplest form. In the dramatic code, change is fueled by desire. The "story world" doesn't boil down to "I think, therefore I am" but rather "I want, therefore I am." Desire in all of its facets is what makes the world go around. It is what propels all conscious, living things and gives them direction. A story tracks what a person wants, what he'll do to get it, and what costs he'll have to pay along the way. Once a character has a desire, the story "walks" on two "legs": acting and learning. A character pursuing a desire takes actions to get what he wants, and he learns new information about better ways to get it. Whenever he learns new information, he makes a decision and changes his course of action. All stories move in this way. But some story forms highlight one of these activities over the other. The genres that highlight taking action the most are myth and its later version, the action form. The genres that highlight learning the most are the detective story and the multiperspective drama. Any character who goes after a desire and is impeded is forced to struggle (otherwise the story is over). And that struggle makes him change. So the ultimate goal of the dramatic code, and of the storyteller, is to present a change in a character or to illustrate why that change did not occur. The different forms of storytelling frame human change in differing ways: ■ Myth tends to show the widest character arc, from birth to death and from animal to divine. ■ Plays typically focus on the main character's moment of decision. ■ Film (especially American film) shows the small change a character might undergo by seeking a limited goal with great intensity. ■ Classic short stories usually track a few events that lead the character to gain a single important insight. ■ Serious novels typically depict how a person interacts and changes within an entire society or show the precise mental and emotional processes leading up to his change. ■ Television drama shows a number of characters in a minisociety struggling to change simultaneously. Drama is a code of maturity. The focal point is the moment of change, the impact, when a person breaks free of habits and weaknesses and ghosts from his past and transforms to a richer and fuller self. The dramatic code expresses the idea that human beings can become a better version of themselves, psychologically and morally. And that's why people love it. KEY POINT: Stories don't show the audience the "real world"; they show the story world. The story world isn't a copy of life as it is. It's life as human beings imagine it could be. It is human life condensed and heightened so that the audience can gain a better understanding of how life itself works. THE STORY BODY A great story describes human beings going through an organic process. But it is also a living body unto itself. Even the simplest children's story is made up of many parts, or subsystems, that connect with and feed off one another. Just as the human body is made up of the nervous system, the circulatory system, the skeleton, and so on, a story is made of subsystems like the characters, the plot, the revelations sequence, the story world, the moral argument, the symbol web, the scene weave, and symphonic dialogue (all of which will be explained in upcoming chapters). We might say that theme, or what I call moral argument, is the brain of the story. Character is the heart and circulation system. Revelations are the nervous system. Story structure is the skeleton. Scenes are the skin. KEY POINT: Each subsystem of the story consists of a web of elements that help define and differentiate the other elements.`

Most writers don't use the best process for creating a story. They use the easiest one. We could describe it in four words: external, mechanical, piecemeal, generic. Of course, there are lots of variations on this process, but they all work something like this. The writer comes up with a generic premise, or story idea, that is a vague copy of one that already exists. Or it's a combination of two stories that he has creatively (he thinks) stuck together. Knowing the importance of a strong main character, our writer focuses almost all of his attention on the hero. He "fleshes out" this character mechanically, by tacking on as many traits as possible, and figures he'll make the hero change in the last scene. He thinks of the opponent and minor characters as separate from and less important than the hero. So they are almost always weak, poorly defined characters. When it comes to theme, our writer avoids it entirely so that no one can accuse him of "sending a message." Or he expresses it strictly in the dialogue. He sets the story in whatever world seems normal for that character, most likely a major city, since that's where most people in his audience live. He doesn't bother using symbols because that would be obvious and pretentious. He comes up with a plot and a scene sequence based on one question: What happens next? Often he sends his hero on a physical journey. He organizes his plot using the three-act structure, an external imprint that divides the story into three pieces but doesn't link the events under the surface. As a result, the plot is episodic, with each event or scene standing alone. He complains that he has "secondact problems" and can't understand why the story doesn't build to a climactic punch that moves the audience deeply. Finally, he writes dialogue that simply pushes the plot along, with all conflict focused on what is happening. If he is ambitious, he has his hero state the theme directly in dialogue near the end of the story. If most writers use an approach that is external, mechanical, piecemeal, and generic, the writing process we will work through might be described as internal, organic, interconnected, and original. I must warn you right up front: this process isn't easy. But I believe that this approach, or some variant of it, is the only one that really works. And it can be learned. Here's the writing process we're going to use in this book: We will work through the techniques of great storytelling in the same order that you construct your story. Most important, you will construct your story from the inside out. That means two things: (1) making the story personal and unique to you and (2) finding and developing what is original within your story idea. With each chapter, your story will grow and become more detailed, with each part connected to every other part. ■ Premise We begin with the premise, which is your entire story condensed to a single sentence. That premise will suggest the essence of the story, and we will use that to figure out how to develop it so as to get the most out of the idea. ■ Seven Key Story Structure Steps The seven key story structure steps are the major stages of your story's development and of the dramatic code hidden under its surface. Think of the seven structure steps as your story's DNA. Determining the seven key steps will give your story a solid, stable foundation. ■ Character Next, we will create the characters, not by pulling them out of thin air but by drawing them out of your original story idea. We will connect and compare each character to every other character so that each one is strong and well defined. Then we'll figure out the function each must perform in helping your hero develop. ■ Theme (Moral Argument) The theme is your moral vision, your view of how people should act in the world. But instead of making the characters a mouthpiece for a message, we will express the theme that is inherent in the story idea. And we'll express the theme through the story structure so that it both surprises and moves the audience. ■ Story World Next, we'll create the world of the story as an outgrowth of your hero. The story world will help you define your hero and show the audience a physical expression of his growth. ■ Symbol Web Symbols are packets of highly compressed meaning. We'll figure out a web of symbols that highlight and communicate different aspects of the characters, the story world, and the plot. ■ Plot From the characters we will discover the right story form; the plot will grow from your unique characters. Using the twenty-two story structure steps (the seven key steps plus fifteen more), we will design a plot in which all the events are connected under the surface and build to a surprising but logically necessary ending.`

He just happens to be the best premise writer in Hollywood. Take Jurassic Park, for example. Crichton's story might have come from this designing principle: "What if you took the two greatest heavyweights of evolution—dinosaurs and humans—and forced them to fight to the death in the same ring?" Now that's a story I want to see. There are many ways to start the writing process. Some writers prefer to begin by breaking the story into its seven primary steps, which we will explore in the next chapter. But most begin with the shortest expression of the story as awhole, the premise line. WHAT IS THE PREMISE? The premise is your story stated in one sentence. It is the simplest combination of character and plot and typically consists of some event that starts the action, some sense of the main character, and some sense of the outcome of the story. Some examples: ■ The Godfather: The youngest son of a Mafia family takes revenge on the men who shot his father and becomes the new Godfather. ■ Moonstruck: While her fiance visits his mother in Italy, a woman falls in love with the man's brother. ■ Casablanca: A tough American expatriate rediscovers an old flame only to give her up so that he can fight the Nazis. ■ A Streetcar Named Desire: An aging beauty tries to get a man to marry her while under constant attack from her sister's brutish husband. ■ Star Wars: When a princess falls into mortal danger, a young man uses his skills as a fighter to save her and defeat the evil forces of a galactic empire. There are all kinds of practical reasons why a good premise is so crucial to your success. First, Hollywood is in the business of selling movies worldwide, with a big chunk of the revenue coming the opening weekend. So producers look for a premise that is "high concept"—meaning that the film can be reduced to a catchy one-line description that audiences will understand instantly and come rushing to the theater to see. Second, your premise is your inspiration. It's the "lightbulb" moment when you say, "Now that would make a terrific story," and that excitement gives you the perseverance to go through months, even years, of hard writing. This leads to another important point: for better or worse, the premise is also your prison. As soon as you decide to pursue one idea, there are potentially thousands of ideas that you won't be writing about. So you'd better be happy with the special world you've chosen. KEY POINT: What you choose to write about is far more important than any decision you make about how to write it. One last reason you must have a good premise is that it's the one decision on which every other decision you make during the writing process is based. Character, plot, theme, symbol—it all comes out of this story idea. If you fail at the premise, nothing else will help. If a building's foundation is flawed, no amount of work on the floors above will make the building stable. You may be terrific at character, a master at plot, or a genius at dialogue. But if your premise is weak, there is nothing you can do to save the story. KEY POINT: Nine out of ten writers fail at the premise. The big reason so many writers fail here is that they don't know how to develop the idea, how to dig out the gold that's buried within it. They don't realize that the great value of a premise is that it allows you to explore the full story, and the many forms it might take, before you actually write it. Premise is a classic example of where a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Most screenwriters know the importance Hollywood places on having a high-concept premise. What they don't know is that this marketing pitch is never going to tell them what the organic story demands.`

These are the scenes just before and after the twist that makes your premise unique. The average feature film has forty to seventy scenes. A novel may have double or triple that number. Only by knowing the full craft of storytelling can you overcome the limitations of the high concept and tell the whole story successfully. The first technique for finding the gold in an idea is time. Take a lot of it at the beginning of the writing process. I'm not talking about hours or even days. I'm talking about weeks. Don't make the amateurish mistake of getting a hot premise and immediately running off to write scenes. You'll get twenty to thirty pages into the story and run into a dead end you can't escape. The premise stage of the writing process is where you explore your story's grand strategy—seeing the big picture and figuring out the story's general shape and development. You start out with almost nothing to go on. That's why the premise stage is the most tentative of the entire writing process. You are putting out feelers in the dark, exploring possibilities to see what works and what doesn't, what forms an organic whole and what falls apart. That means you have to remain flexible, open to all possibilities. For the same reason, this is where using an organic creative method as your guide is most important. DEVELOPING YOUR PREMISE In the weeks you take to explore your premise, use these steps to come up with a premise line you can turn into a great story. Step 1: Write Something That May Change Your Life This is a very high standard, but it may be the most valuable piece of advice you'll ever get as a writer. I've never seen a writer go wrong following it. Why? Because if a story is that important to you, it may be that important to a lot of people in the audience. And when you're done writing the story, no matter what else happens, you've changed your life. You might say, "I'd love to write a story that changes my life, but how do I know it will change my life before I've written it?" Simple: do some self-exploration, something most writers, incredibly enough, never do. Most writers are content to think of a premise that's a loose copy of someone else's movie, book, or play. It seems to have commercial appeal, but it's not personal to the writer in any way. This story will never rise above the generic, and so it is bound to fail. To explore yourself, to have a chance to write something that may change your life, you have to get some data on who you are. And you have to get it outside of you, in front of you, so you can study it from a distance. Two exercises can help you do this. First, write down your wish list, a list of everything you would like to see up onthe screen, in a book, or at the theater. It's what you are passionately interested in, and it's what entertains you. You might jot down characters you have imagined, cool plot twists, or great lines of dialogue that have popped into your head. You might list themes that you care about or certaingenres that always attract you. Write them all down on as many sheets of paper as you need. This is your own personal wish list, so don't reject anything. Banish thoughts like "That would cost too much money." And don't organize while you write. Let one idea trigger another. The second exercise is to write a premise list. This is a list of every premise you've ever thought of. That might be live, twenty, fifty, or more. Again, take as many sheets of paper as you need. The key requirement of the exercise is that you express each premise in one sentence. This forces you to be very clear about each idea. And it allows you to see all your premises together in one place. Once you have completed both your wish list and your premise list, lay them out before you and study them. Look for core elements that repeat themselves on both lists. Certain characters and character types may recur, a quality of voice may seep through the lines of dialogue, one or two kinds of stories (genres) may repeat, or there may be a theme or subject matter or time period that you keep going back to. As you study, key patterns will start to emerge about what you love. This, in the rawest form possible, is your vision. It's who you are, as a writer and as a human being, on paper in front of you. Go back to it often.`

They won't guarantee that you write a story that changes your life. Nothing can do that. But once you've done this essential bit of self-exploration, any premise you come up with is likely to be more personal and original. Step 2: Look for What's Possible One of the biggest reasons writers fail at the premise stage is that they don't know how to spot their story's true potential. This takes experience as well as technique. What you're looking for here is where the idea might go, how it might blossom. Don't jump on a single possibility right away, even if it looks really good. KEY POINT: Explore your options. The intent here is to brainstorm themany different paths the idea can take and then to choose the best one. One technique for exploring possibilities is to see if anything is promised by the idea. Some ideas generate certain expectations, things that must happen to satisfy the audience if this idea were to play out in a full story. These "promises" can lead you to the best option for developing the idea. A more valuable technique for seeing what's possible in the idea is to ask yourself, "What if. . . ?" The "what if" question leads to two places: your story idea and your own mind. It helps you define what is allowed in the story world and what is not. It also helps you explore your mind as it plays in this make- believe landscape. The more often you ask "What if. . . ?" the more fully you can inhabit this landscape, flesh out its details, and make it compelling for an audience. The point here is to let your mind go free. Don't censor or judge yourself. Don't ever tell yourself that any idea you come up with is stupid. "Stupid" ideas often lead to creative breakthroughs. To understand this process better, let's look at some stories that have already been written and play around with what the authors might have been thinking as they explored the deeper possibilities of their premise ideas. Witness (by Earl W. Wallace & William Kelley, story by William Kelley, 1985) A boy who witnesses a crime is a classic setup for a thriller. It promises nail-biting jeopardy, intense action, and violence. But what if you push the story much further, to explore violence in America? What if you show the two extremes of the use of force—violence and pacifism—by having the boy travel from the peaceful Amish world to the violent city? What if you then force a good man of violence, the cop hero, to enter the Amish world and fall in love? And then what if you bring violence into the heart of pacifism? Tootsie (by Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal, story by Don McGuire and Larry Gelbart, 1982) The promise that immediately comes to the audience's mind for this idea is the fun of seeing a man dressed as a woman. And you know they will want to see this character in as many difficult situations as possible. But what if you go beyond these useful but obvious expectations? What if you play up the hero's strategizing to show how men play the game of love from the inside? What if you make the hero a chauvinist who is forced to take on the one disguise—that of a woman—that he least wants but most needs to take on in order to grow? What if you heighten the pace and the plot by pushing the story toward farce, showing a lot of men and women chasing after each other at the same time? Chinatown (by Robert Towne, 1974) A man who investigates a murder in 1930s Los Angeles promises all the revelations, twists, and surprises of a good whodunit. But what if the crime just keeps getting bigger? What if the detective starts investigating the smallest "crime" possible, adultery, and ends up finding out that the entire city has been built on murder? Then you could make the revelations bigger and bigger until you reveal to the audience the deepest, darkest secrets of American life. The Godfather (novel by Mario Puzo, screenplay by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, 1972) A story about a Mafia family promises ruthless killers and violent crime. But what if you make the head of the family much bigger, make him a kind of king in America? What if he is the head of the dark side of America, just as powerful in the underworld as the president is in official America? Because this man is a king, you could create grand tragedy, a Shakespearean fall and rise where one king dies and another takes his place. What if you turn a simple crime story into a dark American epic?`

But what if you want to take the idea of justice beyond the typical capture of the murderer? What if you want to show the ultimate poetic justice? What if the murdered man deserves to die, and a natural jury of twelve men and women serves as both his judge and his executioner? Big (by Gary Ross & Anne Spielberg 1988) A boy who suddenly wakes up to find he is a full-grown man promises to be a fun comedic fantasy. But what if you write a fantasy not set in some far-off, bizarre world but in a world an average kid would recognize? What if you send him to a real boy's Utopia, a toy company, and let him go out with a pretty, sexy woman? Anil what if the story isn't just about a boy get- ting big physically but one that shows the ideal blend of man and boy for living a happy adult life? Step 3: Identify the Story Challenges and Problems There are rules of construction that apply to all stories. But each story has its own unique set of rules, or challenges, as well. These are particular problems that are deeply embedded in the idea, and you cannot escape them. Nor do you want to. These problems are signposts for finding your true story. You must confront these problems head-on and solve them if you are to execute your story well. Most writers, if they identify the problems at all, do so after they've written the complete story. That's fattoo late. The trick is to learn how to spot inherent problems right at the premise line. Of course, even the best writers can't spot all the problems this soon in the process. But as you master the key techniques of character, plot, theme, story world, symbol, and dialogue, you will be pleasantly surprised at how well you can dig out the difficulties in any idea. Here are just a few of the challenges and problems inherent to the following story ideas. Star Wars (by George Lucas, 1977) In any epic, but especially a space epic like Star Wars, you must introduce a wide range of characters quickly and then keep them interacting over vast space and time. You must make the futuristic story believable and recognizable in the present. And you must find a way to create character change in a hero who is morally good from the beginning. Forrest Gump (novel by Winston Groom, screenplay by Eric Roth, 1994) How do you turn forty years of historical moments into a cohesive, organic, personal story? Problems include creating a mentally challenged hero who is able to drive the plot, have believably deep insights, and experience character change while balancing whimsy with genuine sentiment. Beloved (by Toni Morrison, 1988) The main challenge for Toni Morrison is to write a tale of slavery in which the hero is not portrayed as a victim. An ambitious story like this has numerous problems that must be solved: keeping narrative drive in spite of constant jumps between past and present, making events in the distant past seem meaningful to an audience today, driving the plot with reactive characters, showing the effects of slavery on the minds of the people who lived it, and demonstrating how its effects continue to punish years after the slavery is over. Jaws (novel by Peter Bencbley, screenplay by Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb, 1975) Writing a "realistic" horror story—in which characters fight one of man's natural predators—poses many problems: creating a fair fight with an opponent that has limited intelligence, setting up a situation where the shark can attack often, and ending the story with the hero going mano a mano with the shark. Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (by Mark Twain, 1885) The main challenge facing the writer of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is huge: How do you show the moral—or more precisely, immoral—fabric of an entire nation in fictional terms? This brilliant story idea carries with it some major problems: using a boy to drive the action; maintaining story momentum and strong opposition in a traveling, episodic structure; and believably showing a simple and not entirely admirable boy gaining great moral insight. The Great Gats by (by F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925) Fitzgerald's challenge is to show the American dream corrupted and reduced to a competition for fame and money. His problems are just as daunting. He must create narrative drive when the hero is someone else's helper, make the audience care about shallow people, and somehow turn a small love story into a metaphor for America.`

Problems he must solve include mixing past and present events without confusing the audience, maintaining narrative drive, and providing hope in a desperate and violent conclusion. Step 4: Find the Designing Principle Given the problems and the promises inherent in your idea, you must now come up with an overall strategy for how you will tell your story. Your overall story strategy, stated in one line, is the designing principle of your story. The designing principle helps you extend the premise into deep structure. KEY POINT: The designing principle is what organizes the story as a whole. It is the internal logic of the story, what makes the parts hang together organically so that the story becomes greater than the sum of its parts. It is what makes the story original. In short, the designing principle is the seed of the story. And it is the single most important factor in making your story original and effective. Sometimes this principle is a symbol or a metaphor (known as the central symbol, the grand metaphor, or the root metaphor). But it is often larger than that. The designing principle tracks the fundamental process that will unfold over the course of the story. The designing principle is difficult to see. And in truth, most stories don't have one. They are standard stories, told generically. That's the difference between a premise, which all stories have, and a designing principle—which only good stories have. The premise is concrete; it's what actually happens. The designing principle is abstract; it is the deeper process going on in the story, told in an original way. Stated in one line: Designing principle = story process + original execution Let's say you are a writer who wants to show the intimate workings of the Mafia in America, as literally hundreds of screenwriters and novelists have done. If you were really good, you might come up with this designing principle (for The Godfather): Use the classic fairy-tale strategy of showing how the youngest of three sons becomes the new "king." What's important is that the designing principle is the "synthesizing idea," the "shaping cause"1 of the story; it's what internally makes the story a single unit and what makes it different from all other stories. KEY POINT: Find the designing principle, and stick to it. Be diligent in discovering this principle, and never take your eye off it during the long writing process. Let's take a look at Tootsie to see how the difference between the premise and the designing principle plays out in an actual story. ■ Premise When an actor can't get work, he disguises himself as a woman and gets a role in a TV series, only to fall in love with one of the female members of the cast. ■ Designing Principle Force a male chauvinist to live as a woman. How do you find the designing principle in your premise? Don't make the mistake most writers make at this point. Instead of coming up with a unique designing principle, they pick a genre and impose it on the premise and then force the story to hit the beats (events) typical of that genre. The result is mechanical, generic, unoriginal fiction. You find the designing principle by teasing it out of the simple one-line premise you have before you. Like a detective, you "induce" the form of the story from the premise. This doesn't mean that there is only one designing principle per idea or that it's fixed or predetermined. There are many possible designing principles or forms that you can glean from your premise and by which you can develop your story. Each gives you different possibilities of what to say, and each brings inherent problems that you must solve. Again, let your technique help you out. One way of coming up with a designing principle is to use a journey or similar traveling metaphor. Huck Finn's raft trip down the Mississippi River with Jim, Marlow's boat trip up the river into the "heart of darkness," Leopold Bloom's travels through Dublin in Ulysses, Alice's fall down the rabbit hole into the`

Citizen Kane ■ Premise Tell the life story of a rich newspaper baron. ■ Designing Principle Use a number of storytellers to show that a man's life can never be known. Step 5: Determine Your Best Character in the Idea Once you have a lock on the designing principle of your story, it's time to focus on your hero. KEY POINT: Always tell a story about your best character. "Best" doesn't mean "nicest." It means "the most fascinating, challenging, and complex," even if that character isn't particularly likable. The reason you want to tell a story about your best character is that this is where your interest, and the audience's interest, will inevitably go. You always want this character driving the action. The way you determine the best character embedded in the idea is to ask yourself this crucial question: Who do I love? You can find the answer by asking yourself a few more questions: Do I want to see him act? Do I love the way he thinks? Do I care about the challenges he has to overcome? If you can't find a character you love implied in the story idea, move on to another idea. If you find him but he is not currently the main character, change the premise right now so that he is. If you are developing an idea that seems to have multiple main characters, you will have as many story lines as main characters, and so you must find the best character for each story line. Step 6: Get a Sense of the Central Conflict Once you have an idea of who will drive the story, you want to figure out what your story is about at the most essential level. That means determining the central conflict of the story. To figure out the central conflict, ask yourself "Who fights whom over what?" and answer the question in one succinct line. The answer to that is what your story is really about, because all conflict in the story will essentially boil down to this one issue. The next two chapters will expand on this conflict in often complex ways. But you need to keep this one-line statement of conflict, along with the designing principle, in front of you at all times. Step 7: Get a Sense of the Single Cause-and-Effect Pathway Every good, organic story has a single cause-and-effect pathway: A leads to B, which leads to C, and so on all the way to Z. This is the spine of the story, and if you don't have a spine or you have too many spines, your story will fall apart (we'll talk about multiple-hero stories in a moment). Let's say you came up with this premise: A man falls in love and fights his brother for control of a winery. Notice that this is a split premise with two cause-andeffect trajectories. One of the great advantages of using these techniques to develop your premise is that it's much easier to spot problems and find solutions when you've written only one line. Once you write a full story or script, the story problems feel like they're set in concrete. But when you've written only one sentence, you can make a simple change and turn a split premise into a single line, such as this: Through the love of a good woman, a man defeats his brother for control of a winery. The trick to finding the single cause-and-effect pathway is to ask yourself "What is my hero's basic action?" Your hero will take many actions over the course of the story. But there should be one action that is most important, that unifies every other action the hero takes. That action is the cause-and-effect path. For example, let's go back to the one-line premise for Star Wars: When a princess falls into mortal danger, a young man uses his skills as a fighter to save her and defeat the evil forces of a galactic empire. In forcing ourselves to describe Star Wars in a single line, we see that the one action that unites all the myriad actions of that film is "uses his skills as a fighter."`

W—weaknesses at the beginning: uptight, haughty banker A—basic action: becomes involved with a gang of outlaws C—changed person: gives aid to the poor ■ A shy, timid man becomes involved with a gang of outlaws and gets drunk with fame. W—weaknesses at the beginning: shy, timid man A— basic action: becomes involved with a gang of outlaws C— changed person: gets drunk with fame Any of these are possible character changes that you can glean from an initial one-line premise about a man becoming an outlaw. Let's work through this technique for a couple of familiar stories. Star Wars ■ Premise When a princess falls into mortal danger, a young man uses his skills as a fighter to save her and defeat the evil forces of a galactic empire. W—weaknesses at the beginning: naive, impetuous, paralyzed, unfocused, lacking confidence A—basic action: uses his skills as a fighter C—changed person: self-esteem, a place among the chosen few, a fighter for good Luke's initial weaknesses are definitely not the qualities of a fighter. But when constantly forced to use skills as a fighter, he is strengthened into a confident fighter for the good. The Godfather ■ Premise The youngest son of a Mafia family takes revenge on the men who shot his father and becomes the new Godfather. W—weaknesses at the beginning: unconcerned, afraid, mainstream, legitimate, separated from the family A—basic action: takes revenge C—changed person: tyrannical, absolute ruler of the family The Godfather is a perfect example of why you want to go to the opposites of the basic action to determine the weaknesses and change of your hero. If Michael begins the story as a vengeful man, raking revenge on the men who shot his father will only make him seem more of the same. There's no character change. But what if he starts off the opposite of vengeful? An unconcerned, afraid, mainstream, legitimate man, separated from his Mafia family, who then takes revenge could become the tyrannical, absolute ruler of the family. This is a radical change, no doubt. But it is a totally believable one. Note that what you end up with using this technique are only possible character changes for your story. Premise work, especially concerning character change, is extremely tentative. Be open to considering different character changes as you work through the writing process. We will explore this crucial story element in much greater detail in the next two chapters. Step 9: Figure Out the Hero's Possible Moral Choice The central theme of a story is often crystallized by a moral choice the hero must make, typically near the end of the story. Theme is your view of the proper way to act in the world. It is your moral vision, and it is one of the main reasons you are writing your story. Theme is best expressed through the structure of the story, through what I call the moral argument. This is where you, the author, make a case for how to live, not through philosophical argument, but through the actions of characters going after a goal (for details, see Chapter 5, "Moral Argument"). Probably the most important step in that argument is the final moral choice you give to the hero. A lot of writers make the mistake of giving their hero a fake choice. A fake choice is between a positive and a negative. For example, you may force your hero to choose between going to prison and winning the girl. The outcome is obvious. KEY POINT: To be a true choice, your hero must either select one of two positive outcomes or, on rare occasions, avoid one of two negative outcomes (as in Sophie's Choice).`

A classic example of a choice between two positives is between love and honor. In A Farewell to Arms, the hero chooses love. In The Maltese Falcon (and almost all detective stories), the hero chooses honor. Again, notice that this technique is about finding possible moral choices. That's because the choice you come up with now may change completely by the time you have written the full story. This technique simply forces you to start thinking, in practical terms, about your theme from the very beginning of the writing process. Step 10: Gauge the Audience Appeal When you've done all your premise work, ask yourself one final question: Is this single story line unique enough to interest a lot of people besides me? This is the question of popularity, of commercial appeal. You must be ruthless in answering it. If you look at your premise and realize that the only people who will want to see your story are you and your immediate family, I would strongly caution you against using that premise as the basis for a full story. You should always write first for yourself; write what you care about. But you shouldn't write only for yourself. One of the biggest mistakes writers make is to fall into the trap of either-or thinking: either I write what I care about, or I write what will sell. This is a false distinction, born of the old romantic notion of writing in a garret and suffering for your art. Sometimes you get an idea that you simply must write. Or you get a great idea and you have no idea whether an audience will like it. But remember, you will have many more ideas in your life than you can possibly develop as full stories. Always try to write something that you care about and also think will appeal to an audience. Your writing should mean a lot to you personally. But writing for an audience makes it a lot easier to do what you love. Creating Your Premise—Writing Exercise I ■ Premise Write down your premise in one sentence. Ask yourself if this premise line has the makings of a story that could change your life. ■ Wish List and Premise List Write down your wish list and your premise list. Study them together to identify the core elements of what you care about and enjoy. ■ Possibilities Look for what is possible in the premise. Write down options. ■ Story Challenges and Problems Describe as many of the story challenges and problems that are unique to your idea as you can think of. ■ Designing Principle Come up with the designing principle of your story idea. Remember that this principle describes some deeper process or form in which the story will play out in a unique way. ■ Best Character Determine the best character in the idea. Make that character the hero of your premise. ■ Conflict Ask yourself "Who is my hero fighting, and what is he fighting about?" ■ Basic Action Find the single cause-and-effect pathway by identifying a basic action that your hero will take in the story. ■ Character Change Figure out the possible character change for your hero, starting with the basic action (A) and then going to the opposites of the basic action to determine his weaknesses (W) at the beginning and his change (C) at the end. ■ Moral Choice List a moral choice your hero may have to make near the end of the story. Make sure it's a difficult but plausible choice. ■ Audience Appeal Ask yourself if your premise is likely to appeal to a wider audience. If not, go back to the likely to appeal to a wider audience. If not, go back to the drawing board. Let's look at Tootsie so you can see how you might work through the premise process. Toots ie (by Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal, story by Don McGuirc and Larry Gelbart, 1982) ■ Premise When an actor can't get work, he disguises himself as a woman and gets a role in a TV series, only to fall in love with one of the female members of the cast. ■ Possibilities You could take a funny look at the modern dating dance, but also dissect the deep immorality that underlies how men and women act toward each other in the most intimate part of their lives. ■ Story Challenges How do you show the effect of men's immoral actions against women without seeming to attack one entire gender while making the other gender look innocent?`

DESIRE Once the weakness and need have been decided, you must give the hero desire. Desire is what your hero wants in the story, his particular goal. A story doesn't become interesting to the audience until the desire comes into play. Think of the desire as the story track that the audience "rides along." Everyone gets on the "train" with the hero, and they all go after the goal together. Desire is the driving force in the story, the line from which everything else hangs. Desire is intimately connected to need. In most stories, when the hero accomplishes his goal, he also fulfills his need. Let's look at a simple example from nature. A lion is hungry and needs food (a physical need). He sees a herd of antelope go by and spots a young one that he wants (desire). If he can catch the little antelope, he won't be hungry anymore. End of story. One of the biggest mistakes a writer can make is to confuse need and desire or to think of them as a single step. They are in fact two unique story steps that form the beginning of your story, so you have to be clear about the function of each. Need has to do with overcoming a weakness within the character. A hero with a need is always paralyzed in some way at the beginning of the story by his weakness. Desire is a goal outside the character. Once the hero comes up with his desire, he is moving in a particular direction and taking actions to reach his goal. Need and desire also have different functions in relation to the audience. Need lets the audience see how the hero must change to have a better life. It is the key to the whole story, but it remains hidden, under the surface. Desire gives the audience something to want along with the hero, something they can all be moving toward through the various twists and turns—and even digressions—of the story. Desire is on the surface and is what the audience thinks the story is about. This can be shown schematically as follows: Let's look at some story examples to see the crucial difference between need and desire. Saving Private Ryan ■ Need Hero John Miller must do his duty in spite of his fear (psychological and moral). ■ Desire He wants to find Private Ryan and bring him back alive. The Full Monty ■ Need Each of the men in the group needs to regain his self-respect (psychological). ■ Desire They want to make a lot of money by performing naked in front of a roomful of women. The Verdict ■ Need The hero must regain his self-respect (psychological) and learn to act with justice toward others (moral). ■ Desire As in all courtroom dramas, he wants to win the case. Chinatown ■ Need Jake must overcome his cocky arrogance and learn to trust others (psychological). He also has to stop using people for money and bring a murderer to justice because it is the right thing to do (moral). ■ Desire As in all detective stories, Jake's desire is to solve a mystery— in this case, to find out who killed Hollis and why. KEY POINT: Your hero's true desire is what he wants in this story, not what he wants in life. For example, the hero in Saving Private Ryan wants to stop fighting, go home, and be with his family. But that isn't what tracks this particular story. His goal in this story, requiring him to take a series of very specific actions, is to bring back Private Ryan.`

They think, "I'll just skip the weakness-and-need step and start with desire." They've just made a pact with the devil. Opening with desire does give your story a quick start. But it also kills the payoff, the ending of the story. Weakness and need are the foundation of any story. They are what makes it possible for your hero to change at the end. They're what makes the story personal and meaningful. And they're what makes the audience care. Don't skip that first step. Ever. 3. OPPONENT Writers often mistakenly think of the opponent, also known as the antagonist, as the character who looks evil, sounds evil, or does evil things. This way of looking at the opponent will prevent you from ever writing a good story. Instead you must see the opponent structurally, in terms of his function in the story. A true opponent not only wants to prevent the hero from achieving his desire but is competing with the hero for the same goal. Notice that this way of defining the opponent organically links this step to your hero's desire. It is only by competing for the same goal that the hero and the opponent are forced to come into direct conflict and to do so again and again throughout the story. If you give your hero and opponent two separate goals, each one can get what he wants without coming into direct conflict. And then you have no story at all. If you look at a number of good stories, it often appears, at first glance, that hero and opponent are not competing for the same goal. But look again. See if you can spot what they are really fighting about. For example, in a detective story, it appears that the hero wants to catch the killer and the opponent wants to get away. But they are really fighting over which version of reality everyone will believe. The trick to creating an opponent who wants the same goal as the hero is to find the deepest level of conflict between them. Ask yourself "What is the most important thing they are fighting about?" That must be the focus of your story. KEY POINT: To find the right opponent, start with your hero's specific goal; whoever wants to keep him from getting it is an opponent. Note that writers often talk about having a hero whose opponent is himself. This is a mistake that will cause all kinds of structural problems. When we talk about a hero fighting himself, we are really referring to a weakness within the hero. Let's look at some opponents. The Godfather Michael's first opponent is Sollozzo. However, his main opponent is the more powerful Barzini, who is the hidden power behind Sollozzo and wants to bring the entire Corleone family down. Michael and Barzini compete over the survival of the Corleone family and who will control crime in New York. Star Wars Luke's opponent is the ruthless Darth Vader, and each is competing over who will control the universe. Vader represents the evil forces of the tyrannical Empire. Luke represents the forces of good, comprised of the Jedi Knights and the democratic Republic. Chinatown Luke any good detective story, Chinatown gives us a unique and tricky opponent who remains hidden until the very end of the story. Jake's opponent turns out to be the rich and powerful Noah Cross. Cross wants to control the future of Los Angeles with his water scheme. But he is not competing with Jake about that. Because Chinatown is a detective story, he and Jake are actually competing over whose version of the truth will be believed. Cross wants everyone to believe that Hollis drowned accidentally and that Evelyn's daughter is his granddaughter. Jake wants everyone to believe that Cross killed Hollis and raped his own daughter.`

After Evelyn's death, he mumbles, "As little as possible." He seems to believe that his life is not only useless hut also destructive. Once again, he has hurt someone he loves. Dances with Wolves Dunbar finds a new reason to live and a new way of being a man because of his new wife and his extended Lakota Sioux family. Ironically, the Lakota way of life is almost at an end, so Dunbar's self- revelation is both positive and negative. If you have given your hero a moral need, his selfrevelation should be moral as well. The hero doesn't just see himself in a new light; he has an insight about the proper way to act toward others. In effect, the hero realizes that he has been wrong, that he has hurt others, and that he must change. He then proves he has changed by taking new moral action. Tootsie Michael realizes what it really means to be a man—"I was a better man with you as a woman than I ever was with a woman as a man. I just gotta learn to do it without the dress"—and he apologizes for hurting the woman he loves. Notice that even though the hero comes right out and says what he learned, he says it in such a clever and funny way that it avoids sermonizing. Adventures of Huckleberry Finn Huck realizes he has been wrong in thinking of Jim as less than human and declares that he would rather go to hell than tell Jim's owner of his whereabouts. Structurally, the step with which self-revelation is most closely connected is need. These two steps communicate the character change of your hero (we'll explore this in more detail in the next chapter). Need is the beginning of the hero's character change. Self-revelation is the end-point of that change. Need is the mark of the hero's immaturity at the beginning of the story. It is what is missing, what is holding him back. Self-revelation is the moment when the hero grows as a human being (unless the knowledge is so painful it destroys him). It is what he learns, what he gains, what allows him to live a better life in the future. 7. NEW EQUILIBRIUM At the new equilibrium, everything returns to normal, and all desire is gone. Except there is now one major difference. The hero has moved to a higher or lower level as a result of going through his crucible. A fundamental and permanent change has occurred in the hero. If the selfrevelation is positive-the hero realizes who he truly is and learns how to live properly in the world —he moves to a higher level. If the hero has a negative revelation-learning he has committed a terrible crime that expresses a corrupt personal flaw—or is incapable of having a self-revelation, the hero falls or is destroyed. Let's look at some examples in which the hero rises. Die Hard John has defeated the criminals, saved his wife, and reaffirmed their love. Pretty Woman Vivian has left the world of prostitution behind and is with the man she loves (who, fortunately, is a billionaire). The Silence of the Lambs Clarice has brought Buffalo Bill to justice, has become an excellent FBI agent, and has apparently conquered her terrifying nightmares. The following document the fall of the hero. Oedipus the King Oedipus gouges out his eyes upon learning that he has killed his father and slept with his mother. The Conversation The hero discovers he has contributed to someone's murder and ends up a shell-shocked man desperately tearing up his apartment to find a listening device. Vertigo The hero drags the woman he loves to the top of a tower to get her to confess to a murder and then looks down in horror when the woman, overcome by guilt, accidentally falls to her death.`

Here's how to use them in your story. ■ Story Events Write down some story events, describing each in a single sentence. The seven steps are not imposed from the outside; they are embedded in the story idea itself. That's why the first thing you need to do to figure out the seven steps is to list some of the events that might be in your story. Usually, when you get an idea for a story, certain events immediately pop into your mind. "This could happen, and this could happen, and this could happen." Story events are usually actions taken by your hero or opponent. These initial thoughts about story events are extremely valuable, even if none of them ends up in the final story. Write down each event in one sentence. The point here is not to be detailed but to get down the basic idea of what happens in each event. You should write down a minimum of five story events, but ten to fifteen would be even better. The more events you list, the easier it is to see the story and find the seven steps. ■ Order of Events Put the story events in some rough order, from beginning to end. Recognize that this will probably not be your final order. What's important is to get a look at how the story might develop from beginning to end. ■ Seven Steps Study the story events, and identify the seven structure steps. KEY POINT: Start by determining the self-revelation, at the end of the story; then go back to the beginning and figure out your hero's need and desire. This technique of starting at the end and going hack to the beginning is one we will use again and again as we figure out character, plot, and theme. It's one of the best techniques in fiction writing because it guaran-tees that your hero and your story are always heading toward the true end-point of the structural journey, which is the selfrevelation. ■ Psychological and Moral Self-Revelation When figuring out the self-revelation, try to give your hero both a psychological and a moral revelation. Be specific about what your hero learns. And be flexible and ready to change what you have written as you figure out the other six steps and as you continue through the entire writing process. Figuring out the seven steps, as well as many of the other parts of your story, is much like doing a crossword puzzle. Some parts will come easily, others only with great difficulty. Use the parts that come easily to figure out the tough parts, and be willing to go back and change what you first wrote when later material gives you a new take on your story. ■ Psychological and Moral Weakness and Need After figuring out the self-revelation, go back to the beginning of the story. Try to give your hero both a psychological and a moral weakness and need. Remember the key difference. A psychological weakness or need affects just the hero. A moral weakness or need affects others. Come up with not one but many weaknesses for your hero. These should be serious flaws, so deep and dangerous that they are ruining your hero's life or have the real possibility of doing so. ■ Problem What is the problem, or crisis, your hero faces at the beginning of the story? Try to make it an outgrowth of your hero's weakness. ■ Desire Be very specific when giving your hero a desire. Make sure your hero's goal is one that will lead him to the end of the story and force him to take a number of actions to accomplish it. ■ Opponent Create an opponent who wants the same goal as the hero and who is exceptionally good at attacking your hero's greatest weakness. You could create hundreds of opponents for your hero. The question is, who's the best one? Start by going back to that crucial question: What is the deepest conflict the hero and opponent are fighting about? You want your main opponent to be just as obsessed with winning the goal as the hero. You want to give your opponent a special ability to attack your hero's greatest weakness, and to do so incessantly while he tries to win the goal. ■ Plan Create a plan that requires the hero to take a number of actions but also to adjust when the initial plan doesn't work. The plan generally shapes the rest of the story. So it must involve many steps. Otherwise you will have a very short story. The plan must also be unique and complex enough that the hero will have to adjust when it fails.`

The battle should involve the hero and the main opponent, and it should decide once and for all who wins the goal. Decide whether it will be a battle of action and violence or a battle of words. Whatever kind of battle you choose, make sure it is an intense experience that puts your hero to the ultimate test. Let's look at a seven-step breakdown from a single story, The Godfather, so that you can see what such a breakdown might look like for your own story. The Godfather (novel by Mario Puzo, screenplay by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, 1972) ■ Hero Michael Corleone. ■ Weaknesses Michael is young, inexperienced, untested, and overconfident. ■ Psychological Need Michael must overcome his sense of superiority and self-righteousness. ■ Moral Need He needs to avoid becoming ruthless like the other Mafia bosses while still protecting his family. ■ Problem Rival gang members shoot Michael's father, the head of the family. ■ Desire He wants to take revenge on the men who shot his father and thereby protect his family. ■ Opponent Michael's first opponent is Sollozzo. However, his true opponent is the more powerful Barzini, who is the hidden power behind Sollozzo and wants to bring the entire Corleone family down. Michael and Barzini compete over the survival of the Corleone family and who will control crime in New York. ■ Plan Michael's first plan is to kill Sollozzo and his protector, the police captain. His second plan is to kill the heads of the other families in a single strike. ■ Battle The final battle is a crosscut between Michael's appearance at his nephew's baptism and the killing of the heads of the five Mafia families. At the baptism, Michael says that he believes in God. Clemenza fires a shotgun into some men getting off an elevator. Moe Green is shot in the eye. Michael, following the liturgy of the baptism, renounces Satan. Another gunman shoots one of the heads of the families in a revolving door. Barzini is shot. Tom sends Tessio off to be murdered. Michael has Carlo strangled. ■ Psychological Self-Revelation There is none. Michael still believes that his sense of superiority and selfrighteousness is justified. ■ Moral Self-Revelation There is none. Michael has become a ruthless killer. The writers use an advanced story structure technique by giving the moral self-revelation to the hero's wife, Kay, who sees what he has become as the door slams in her face. ■ New Equilibrium Michael has killed his enemies and "risen" to the position of Godfather. But morally, he has fallen and become the "devil." This man who once wanted nothing to do with the violence and crime of his family is now its leader and will kill anyone who betrays him or gets in his way. *****`

Right? Wrong. What made that character funny, and what made the entire story work, was the web of characters that helped define the hero and allowed him to be funny. Look below the glossy surface of Dustin Hoffman in a dress and you will see that each character in that story is a unique version of the hero's central moral problem, which is how men mistreat women. Most writers come at character all wrong. They start by listing all the traits of the hero, tell a story about him, and then somehow make him change at the end. That won't work, no matter how hard you try. We're going to work through a different process that I think you will find much more useful. These are the steps: 1. We'll begin not by focusing on your main character but by looking at all your characters together as part of an interconnected web. We'll distinguish them by comparing each to the others according to story function and archetype. 2. Next we'll individualize each character based on theme and opposition. 3. Then we'll concentrate on the hero, "building" him step-by-step so that we end up with a multilayered, complex person that the audience cares about. 4. We'll create the opponent in detail, since this is the most important character after your hero and, in many ways, is the key to defining your hero. 5. We'll end by working through the character techniques for building conflict over the course of the story. CHARACTER WEB The single biggest mistake writers make when creating characters is that they think of the hero and all other characters as separate individuals. Their hero is alone, in a vacuum, unconnected to others. The result is not only a weak hero but also cardboard opponents and minor characters who are even weaker. This great mistake is exacerbated in scriptwriting because of the huge emphasis placed on the high- concept premise. In these stories, the hero seems to be the only person who matters. But ironically, this intense spotlight on the hero, instead of defining him more clearly, only makes him seem like a one-note marketing tool. To create great characters, think of all your characters as part of a web in which each helps define the others. To put it another way, a character is often defined by who he is not. KEY POINT: The most important step in creating your hero, as well as all other characters, is to connect and compare each to the others. Each time you compare a character to your hero, you force yourself to distinguish the hero in new ways. You also start to see the secondary characters as complete human beings, as complex and as valuable as your hero. All characters connect and define each other in four major ways: by story function, archetype, theme, and opposition. Character Web by Function in the Story Every character must serve the purpose of the story, which is found in the story's designing principle (see Chapter 2, on premise). Every character has a specially designed role, or function, to play to help the story fulfill that purpose. Theater director Peter Brook, in speaking about actors, also makes a useful point for writers creating characters: [Brecht] pointed out that every actor has to serve the action of the play.... When [the actor] sees himself in relation to the wholeness of the play he will see that not only is too much characterizing (petty details) often opposed to the play's needs but also that many unnecessary characteristics can actually work against him and make his own appearance less striking.1`

The subplot is used to contrast how the hero and a second character deal with the same problem in slightly different ways. Through comparison, the subplot character highlights traits and dilemmas of the main character. Let's look more closely at Hamlet to see how you might create a true subplot character. We might say that Hamlet's problem, reduced to one line, is to take revenge on the man who killed his father. Similarly, Laertes' problem is to take revenge on the man who killed his father. The contrast focuses on the fact that one killing is premeditated murder and the other is an impetuous, misguided mistake. KEY POINT: The subplot character is usually not the ally. The subplot character, like the ally and the opponent, provides another opportunity to define the hero through comparison and advance the plot. The ally helps the hero reach the main goal. The subplot character tracks a line parallel to the hero, with a different result. ■ Subplot Character in Hamlet Laertes, son of Polonius Let's break down a couple of stories so you can see bow characters contrast through function. The Silence of the Lambs (novel by Thomas Harris, screenplay by Ted Tally, 1991) This is a story about an FBI trainee named Clarice who is searching for a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill. At the suggestion of her boss, Jack, she seeks the help of another serial killer already in prison, the infamous Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter. He is initially hostile to her, but ends up giving her far better training than she receives at the FBI. ■ Hero Clarice Starling ■ Main Opponent Buffalo Bill, the serial killer ■ Second Opponent Dr. Chilton, the warden ■ Fake-Ally Opponent None ■ Ally Jack, her boss at the FBI ■ Fake-Opponent Ally Hannibal Lecter ■ Subplot Character None American Beauty (by Alan Ball, 1999) American Beauty is a comedydrama set in suburbia, so Lester's main opposition is within the family, with his wife, Carolyn, and his daughter, Jane, both of whom dislike him. He soon becomes infatuated with his daughter's friend Angela. But because he's married and she's a teenager, she becomes another opponent. Living next door to Lester is the rigid and conservative Colonel Frank Fitts, who disapproves of Lester's lifestyle. Brad is Lester's coworker who tries to fire him. After Lester blackmails his company into giving him a nice severance package, he begins to live life as he pleases and gains an ally in Ricky Fitts, the boy next door, who sells him pot. Ricky and his father, Frank, are also subplot characters. Lester's central problem is figuring out how to live a meaningful life, one where he can express his deepest desires within a highly conformist society that values appearance and money. Ricky responds to his deadening, militaristic household by selling pot and spying on others with his video camera. Frank represses his homosexual desires by exerting an iron discipline over himself and his family. ■ Hero Lester ■ Main Opponent Carolyn, his wife ■ Second Opponent Jane, his daughter ■ Third Opponent Angela, Jane's pretty friend ■ Fourth Opponent Colonel Frank Fitts ■ Fifth Opponent Brad, his coworker ■ Ally Ricky Fitts ■ Fake-Ally Opponent None ■ Fake-Opponent Ally None ■ Subplot Characters Frank, Ricky`

We see a more unequal but highly informative partnership with Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, the dreamer and the realist, the master and the servant. The buddy strategy allows you essentially to cut the hero into two parts, showing two different approaches to life and two sets of talents. These two characters are "married" into a team in such a way that the audience can see their differences but also see how these differences actually help them work well together, so that the whole becomes greater than the sum of the parts. As in the love story, one of the buddies should be more central than the other. Usually it's the thinker, the schemer, or the strategist of the two, because this character comes up with the plan and starts them off on the desire line. The buddy is a kind of double of the hero, similar in important ways but also different. Structurally, the buddy is both the first opponent and the first ally of the hero. He is not the second hero. Keep in mind that this first opposition between the two buddies is almost never serious or tragic. It usually takes the form of good-natured bickering. Usually, you fill out the character web with at least one outside, dangerous, ongoing opponent. And because most buddy stories use a mythic journey, the buddies encounter a number of secondary opponents on the road. These characters are usually strangers to the buddies, and they are dispatched in quick succession. Each of these opponents should represent a negative aspect of the society that hates the buddies or wants to break them up. This technique is a great way of defining secondary characters quickly and distinguishing one from another. It also helps broaden and deepen the buddy form because you define various aspects of the society in relation to the two leads. One of the most important elements of the buddy web has to do with the fundamental conflict between the friends. There is a snag in the relationship that keeps interfering. This allows an ongoing opposition between the two leads in a traveling story where most of the other opponents are strangers who quickly come and go. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (by William Goldman, 1969) ■Hero Butch ■Main Opponent Sundance ■Second Opponent Railroad boss E. H.

You'll recall that in Chapter 1, we talked about how stories move, with the extreme opposites being linear action and simultaneous action. Having a number of heroes is the main way you create a sense of simultaneous story movement. Instead of tracking the development of a single character (linear), the story compares what many heroes are doing at about the same time. The risk is that you show so many characters at the same time that thestory is no longer a story; it has no forward narrative drive. Even the most simultaneous story must have some linear quality, sequencing events in time, one after another. To write a successful multihero story, you must put each main character through all seven steps— weakness and need, desire, opponent, plan, battle, self-revelation, and new equilibrium. Otherwise the character is not a main character; the audience has not seen him move through the minimal stages of development. Notice that having lots of heroes automatically reduces narrative drive. The more characters you must lay out in detail, the more you risk having your story literally come to a halt. These are some of the techniques you can use to add narrative drive to a multihero story: ■ Have one character emerge over the course of the story as more central than the rest. ■ Give all the characters the same desire line.`

For example, the story may take place over one day or one night. ■ Show the same holiday or group event at least three times over the course of the story to indicate forward drive and change. ■ Have characters occasionally meet by coincidence. Examples of multihero stories that use one or more of these techniques are American Graffiti, Hannah and Her Sisters, L.A. Confidential, Pulp Fiction, The Canterbury Tales, La Ronde, Nashville, Crash, and Smiles of a Summer Night. CHARACTER TECHNIQUE: CUTTING EXTRANEOUS CHARACTERS Extraneous characters are one of the primary causes of episodic, inorganic stories. The first question you must ask yourself when creating any character is "Does this character serve an important function in the overall story?" If he doesn't—if he only provides texture or color—you should consider cutting him entirely. His limited value probably won't justify the time he takes up in the story line. CHARACTER WEB BY ARCHETYPE A second way that characters connect and contrast in a story is through archetype. Archetypes are fundamental psychological patterns within a person; they are roles a person may play in society, essential ways of interacting with others. Because they are basic to all human beings, they cross cultural boundaries and have universal appeal. Using archetypes as a basis for your characters can give them the appearance of weight very quickly, because each type expresses a fundamental pattern that theaudience recognizes, and this same pattern is reflected both within the character and through interaction in the larger society. An archetype resonates deeply with an audience and creates very strong feelings in response. But it is a blunt tool in the writer's repertoire. Unless you give the archetype detail, it can become a stereotype. KEY POINT: Always make the archetype specific and individual to your unique character. Starting with the psychologist Carl Jung, many writers have spoken about what the different archetypes mean and how they connect. For fiction writers, probably the key concept of an archetype is the notion of a shadow. The shadow is the negative tendency of the archetype, a psychological trap that a person can fall into when playing that role or living out that psychology. We need to translate each major archetype and its shadow into practical techniques that you can use in creating a story. This involves thinking of the various archetypes in terms of both the beneficial role and the probable weaknesses that each might have in a story. King or Father ■ Strength Leads his family or his people with wisdom, foresight, and resolve so that they can succeed and grow. ■ Inherent Weaknesses Can force his wife, children, or people to act according to a strict and oppressive set of rules, can remove himself entirely from the emotional realm of his family and kingdom, or may insist that his family and people live solely for his pleasure and benefit. ■ Examples King Arthur, Zeus, The Tempest, The Godfather, Rick in Casablanca, King Lear, Hamlet, Aragorn and Sauron in The Lord of the Rings, Agamemnon in the Iliad, Citizen Kane, Star Wars, Stanley in A Streetcar Named Desire, American Beauty, Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman, Fort Apache, Meet Me in St. Louis, Mary Poppins, Tootsie, The Philadelphia Story,Othello, Red River, Howards End, Chinatown. Queen or Mother ■ Strength Provides the care and protective shell within which the child or the people can grow. ■ Inherent Weaknesses Can be protective or controlling to the point of tyranny, or can use guilt and shame to hold the child close and guarantee her own comfort.`

Wise Old Man, Wise Old Woman, Mentor, or Teacher ■ Strength Passes on knowledge and wisdom so that people can live better lives and society can improve. ■ Inherent Weaknesses Can force students to think a certain way or speak for the glory of himself rather than the glory of his ideas. ■ Examples Yoda in Star Wars. Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, The Matrix, Gandalf and Saruman in The Lord of the Rings, Wuthering Heights, Polonius in Hamlet, Homais in Madame Bovary, Miss Havisham in Great Expectations, Mr. Macawber in David Copperfield, and the Iliad. Warrior ■ Strength The practical enforcer of what is right. ■ Inherent Weaknesses Can live according to the harsh motto of "kill or be killed"; may believe that whatever is weak must be destroyed and so become the enforcer of what is wrong. ■ Examples Achilles and Hector in the Iliad; Luke Skywalker and Han Solo in Star Wars\ Seven Samurai; King Arthur; Thor; Ares; Theseus; Gilgamesh; Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli in The Lord of the Rings, Patton\ Die Hard; Sonny in The Godfather; A Streetcar Named Desire; The Great Santini\ Shane; Platoon; Sundance in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\ The Terminator; and Aliens. Magician or Shaman ■ Strength Can make visible the deeper reality behind the senses and can balance and control the larger or hidden forces of the natural world. ■ Inherent Weakness Can manipulate the deeper reality to enslave others and destroy the natural order. ■ Examples Macbeth, Harry Potter books, Phantom of the Opera, Merlin, Star Wars, Chinatown, Vertigo, Gandalf and Saruman in The Lord of the Rings, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, The Conversation, and detectives like Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, and Nick Charles in The Thin Man. Trickster The trickster is a lower form of the magician archetype and is extremely popular in modern storytelling. ■ Strength Uses confidence, trickery, and a way with words to get what he wants. ■ Inherent Weakness May become a complete liar who looks out only for himself. ■ Examples Odysseus in the Odyssey, Men in Black, Beverly Hills Cop, Crocodile Dundee, Volpone, Loki in Norse mythology, Iago in Othello, Indiana Jones, Home Alone, Catch Me If You Can, Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, Brer Rabbit, Butch in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Sgt. Bilko on The Phil Silvers Show, Michael in Tootsie, American Beauty, Verbal in The Usual Suspects, Oliver Twist, Vanity hair, Tom Sawyer, and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Artist or Clown ■ Strengths Defines excellence for a people or, negatively, shows them what doesn't work; shows them beauty and a vision of the future or what appears to be beautiful but is in fact ugly or foolish. ■ Inherent Weaknesses Can be the ultimate fascist insisting on perfection, may create a special world where all can be controlled, or simply tears everything down so that nothing has value. ■ Examples Stephen in Ulysses and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Achilles in the Iliad, Pygmalion, Frankenstein, King Lear, Hamlet, the master swordsman in Seven Samurai, Michael in Tootsie, Blanche in A Streetcar Named Desire, Verbal in The Usual Suspects, Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye, The Philadelphia Story, and David Copperfield. Lover ■ Strength Provides the care, understanding, and sensuality that can make someone a complete and happy person. ■ Inherent Weaknesses Can lose himself in the other or force the other to stand in his shadow. ■ Examples Paris in the Iliad, Heathcliff and Cathy in Wuthering Heights, Aphrodite, Romeo and Juliet, Etta in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Philadelphia Story, Hamlet, The English Patient, Kay in`

Rebel ■ Strength Has the courage to stand out from the crowd and act against a system that is enslaving people. ■ Inherent Weakness Often cannot or does not provide a better alternative, so ends up only destroying the system or the society. ■ Examples Prometheus, Loki, Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights, American Beauty, Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye, Achilles in the Iliad, Hamlet, Rick in Casablanca, Howards End, Madame Bovary, Rebel Without a Cause, Crime and Punishment, Notes from the Underground, and Reds. Here is a simple but effective character web emphasizing contrasting archetypes: Star Wars (By George Lucas, 1977) Luke (+ R2D2 + CP3O) Darth Vader (Prince-Warrior-Magician) (King-Warrior-Magician) Han Solo (+ Chewbacca) Princess Leia (Rebel-Warrior) (Princess) INDIVIDUALIZING CHARACTERS IN THE WEB Once you have set your essential characters in opposition within the character web, the next step in the process is to make these character func-tions and archetypes into real individuals. But again, you don't create these unique individuals separately, out of whole cloth, with all of them just happening to coexist within the same story. You create a unique hero, opponent, and minor characters by comparing them, but this time primarily through theme and opposition. We'll look at theme in detail in Chapter 5, "Moral Argument." But we need to look at a few of the key concepts of theme now. Theme is your view of the proper way to act in the world, expressed through your characters as they take action inthe plot. Theme is not subject matter, such as "racism" or "freedom." Theme is your moral vision, your view of how to live well or badly, and it's unique for each story you write. KEY POINT: You begin individuating your characters by finding the moral problem at the heart of the premise.You then play out the various possibilities of the moral problem in the body of the story. You play our these various possibilities through the opposition. Specifically, you create a group of opponents (and allies) who force the hero to deal with the central moral problem. And each opponent is a variation on the theme; each deals with the same moral problem in a different way. Let's look at how to execute this crucial technique. 1. Begin by writing down what you think is the central moral problem of your story. If you worked through thetechniques of the premise, you already know this. 2. Compare your hero and all other characters on these parameters: ■ weaknesses ■ need—both psychological and moral ■ desire ■ values ■ power, status, and ability ■ how each faces the central moral problem in the story 3. When making these comparisons, start with the most important relationship in any story, that between the hero and the main opponent. In many ways, this opponent is the key to creating the story, because not only is he the most effective way of defining the hero, but he also shows you the secrets to creating a great character web.`

The key to this strategy is heightening the sense of the hero's might-have-been and lost potential while also showing that the hero's actions are his responsibility. The sense of might-have-been is the single most important element for getting audience sympathy, while the fatal character flaw makes the hero responsible and keeps him from becoming a victim. The audience feels sadness at the lost potential, made more acute by the hero's having gained his great insight mere minutes after it could have saved him. But even though he has died or fallen, the audience is left with a deep sense of inspiration from the hero's moral as well as emotional success. Notice also that this strategy represents a crucial shift from classic Greek drama. The fall of the hero is not the inevitable result of large impersonal forces but rather the consequence of the hero's own choices. Classic tragedies include Hamlet, King Lear, Othello, The Seven Samurai, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Nixon, The Thomas Crown Affair (the original), The Age of Innocence, Wuthering Heights, Vertigo, Amadeus, Le Morte dArthur, American Beauty, Touch of Evil, and Citizen Kane. Wuthering Heights (novel by Emily Bronte, 1847, screenplay by Charles Mac Arthur and Ben Hecht, 1939) Wuthering Heights is a love story written as a classic tragedy. The moral argument follows a number of strands in which characters commit devastating acts on one another. And using the tragic strategy, the characters are all broken by a terrible sense of responsibility for what they've done. Cathy, the hero, is not just a lovelorn girl passively acted on by a man. She is a woman who has a great love, a love that can only be "found in heaven," and she freely gives it up for a man of wealth and comfort. Initially, she is in love with Heathcliff and he with her, but she won't live with him as a poor beggar. She wants "dancing and singing in a pretty world." When she returns from her stay at Edgar Linton's mansion, Heathcliff, her main opponent, criticizes her by demanding to know why she stayed so long. She defends herself by replying that she was having a wonderful time among human beings. She further hurts Heathcliff by ordering him to bathe so she won't be ashamed of him in front of a guest (Edgar). Cathy immediately recovers from her moral fall in the next moment when Edgar asks Cathy how she can tolerate having Heathcliff under her roof. She flares in anger, saying Heathcliff was her friend long before Edgar was and telling him he must speak well of Heathcliff or leave. When Edgar goes, Cathy tears off her pretty clothes, runs to the crag where Heathcliff is waiting, and asks his forgiveness. Bronte's moral argument through Cathy reaches its apex when Cathy tells her servant Nellie that she will marry Edgar while Heathcliff secretly listens in the next room. Now it is Nellie, the ally, who leads the criticism. She asks Cathy why she loves Edgar, and Cathy replies that it's because he's handsome and pleasant and will be rich someday. When Nellie asks about Heathcliff, Cathy says it would degrade her to marry him. Bronte matches this strong moral argument in the dialogue with a brilliant and highly emotional plot beat. Devastated, Heathcliff leaves, but only Nellie can see that. In the next breath, Cathy flips and says she doesn't belong with Edgar. She dreamed that she was thrown out of heaven onto the heath, and she sobbed with joy. She says she only thinks of Heathcliff, but he seems to take pleasure in being cruel. Yet he is more herself than she is. Their souls are the same. In a stunning self-revelation, she says, "I am Heathciff." When she discovers that Heathcliff was listening up to the point where she said it would degrade her to marry him, Cathy rushes out into the storm, screaming out her love. But it is too late. At this point, Bronte makes a radical change in tragic moral argument: she essentially reverses heroes and gives Heathcliff the lead. Heath-cliff returns and attacks ruthlessly, as a love made in heaven must when it has been scorned for something so pedestrian. Heathcliff is a rebel who, like Achilles, is initially right in his revenge against injustice. Bronte uses the "return of the man" technique when Heathcliff comes back, Monte Cristo style, wealthy and sophisticated. The audience feels tremendous triumph in these scenes, and they don't even need to see how the character has made such a huge transformation. The man is back, finally armed as everyone has dreamed of being armed in a similar situation. The audience feels "It could be done—I could have done it," followed by "Now I will take my sweet revenge." With the audience firmly on Heathcliff's side, Bronte reverses the moral argument by having Heathcliff go too far. Even losing such a love in so unjust a manner does not allow you to marry the sister and sister-in-law of your enemies just to pay them back. To see the innocent love that Edgar's sister,`

(revelation or self- revelation) Mountain This highest of all places translates, in human terms, into the land of greatness. This is where the strong go to prove themselves—usually through seclusion, meditation, a lack of comfort, and direct confrontation with nature in the extreme. The mountaintop is the world of the natural philosopher, the great thinker who must understand the forces of nature so he can live with them and sometimes control them. Structurally, the mountain, the high place, is most associated with the reveal, the most mental of the twentytwo story structure steps (see Chapter 8, "Plot"). Revelations in stories are moments of discovery, and they are the keys to turning the plot and kicking it to a "higher," more intense level. Again, the mountain setting makes a one-to-one connection between space and person, in this case, height and insight. This one-to-one connection of space to person is found in the negative expression of the mountain as well. It is often depicted as the site of hierarchy, privilege, and tyranny, typically of an aristocrat who lords it over the common people down below. KEY POINT: The mountain is usually set in opposition to the plain. The mountain and the plain are the only two major natural settings that visually stand in contrast to one another, so storytellers often use the comparative- method to highlight the essential and opposing qualities of each. The mountain world is important in the Moses story, Greek myths of the gods on Mount Olympus, many fairy tales, The Magic Mountain, Lost Horizon, Brokeback Mountain, Batman Begins, The Snows of Kilimanjaro, A farewell to Arms, The Deer Hunter, Last of the Mohicans, Dances with Wolves, Shane, The Shining, and a number of other horror stories. Plain The flat table of the plain is wide open and accessible to all. In contrast to the jungle, which presses in, the plain is totally free. This is why, in stories, it is the place of equality, freedom, and the rights of the common man. But this freedom is not without cost and conflict. Like the surface of the ocean, the extreme flatness of the plain becomes abstract, highlighting the sense of contest or life-and-death struggle that will be played out in this arena. Negatively, the plain is often depicted as the place where the mediocre make their lives. In contrast to the few great ones living up on the moun-taintop, the many average ones live as part of a herd down below. They do not think for themselves, so they are easily led, usually in ways that are destructive to them. We see the plain depicted in most Westerns, including Shane and The Big Country, Days of Heaven, Dances with Wolves, In Cold Blood, Lost Horizon, The Snows of Kilimanjaro, A Farewell to Arms, Blood Simple, and Field of Dreams. River The river is a uniquely powerful natural setting, maybe the greatest one of all when it comes to storytelling. The river is a path, which makes it a perfect physical manifestation for myth stories that rely on the journey for their structure. But the river is more than a path. It is the road into or out of somewhere. This intensifies the sense that the path is a developing, organic line, not just a series of episodes. For example, in Heart of Darkness, the hero goes up the river, ever deeper into the jungle. The line of human development attached to this path is one from civilization to barbaric hell. In The African Queen, the hero reverses that trip and that process by going down the river, out of the jungle. His development begins in a hellish landscape of death, isolation, and madness and moves toward the human world of commitment and love. The river as the place of physical, moral, and emotional passage is found in Adventures of Huckleberry Finn; Deliverance; Heart of Darkness and its adaptation, Apocalypse Now; A River Runs Through It; and The African Queen.`

The key to this strategy is heightening the sense of the hero's might-have-been and lost potential while also showing that the hero's actions are his responsibility. The sense of might-have-been is the single most important element for getting audience sympathy, while the fatal character flaw makes the hero responsible and keeps him from becoming a victim. The audience feels sadness at the lost potential, made more acute by the hero's having gained his great insight mere minutes after it could have saved him. But even though he has died or fallen, the audience is left with a deep sense of inspiration from the hero's moral as well as emotional success. Notice also that this strategy represents a crucial shift from classic Greek drama. The fall of the hero is not the inevitable result of large impersonal forces but rather the consequence of the hero's own choices. Classic tragedies include Hamlet, King Lear, Othello, The Seven Samurai, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Nixon, The Thomas Crown Affair (the original), The Age of Innocence, Wuthering Heights, Vertigo, Amadeus, Le Morte dArthur, American Beauty, Touch of Evil, and Citizen Kane. Wuthering Heights (novel by Emily Bronte, 1847, screenplay by Charles Mac Arthur and Ben Hecht, 1939) Wuthering Heights is a love story written as a classic tragedy. The moral argument follows a number of strands in which characters commit devastating acts on one another. And using the tragic strategy, the characters are all broken by a terrible sense of responsibility for what they've done. Cathy, the hero, is not just a lovelorn girl passively acted on by a man. She is a woman who has a great love, a love that can only be "found in heaven," and she freely gives it up for a man of wealth and comfort. Initially, she is in love with Heathcliff and he with her, but she won't live with him as a poor beggar. She wants "dancing and singing in a pretty world." When she returns from her stay at Edgar Linton's mansion, Heathcliff, her main opponent, criticizes her by demanding to know why she stayed so long. She defends herself by replying that she was having a wonderful time among human beings. She further hurts Heathcliff by ordering him to bathe so she won't be ashamed of him in front of a guest (Edgar). Cathy immediately recovers from her moral fall in the next moment when Edgar asks Cathy how she can tolerate having Heathcliff under her roof. She flares in anger, saying Heathcliff was her friend long before Edgar was and telling him he must speak well of Heathcliff or leave. When Edgar goes, Cathy tears off her pretty clothes, runs to the crag where Heathcliff is waiting, and asks his forgiveness. Bronte's moral argument through Cathy reaches its apex when Cathy tells her servant Nellie that she will marry Edgar while Heathcliff secretly listens in the next room. Now it is Nellie, the ally, who leads the criticism. She asks Cathy why she loves Edgar, and Cathy replies that it's because he's handsome and pleasant and will be rich someday. When Nellie asks about Heathcliff, Cathy says it would degrade her to marry him. Bronte matches this strong moral argument in the dialogue with a brilliant and highly emotional plot beat. Devastated, Heathcliff leaves, but only Nellie can see that. In the next breath, Cathy flips and says she doesn't belong with Edgar. She dreamed that she was thrown out of heaven onto the heath, and she sobbed with joy. She says she only thinks of Heathcliff, but he seems to take pleasure in being cruel. Yet he is more herself than she is. Their souls are the same. In a stunning self-revelation, she says, "I am Heathciff." When she discovers that Heathcliff was listening up to the point where she said it would degrade her to marry him, Cathy rushes out into the storm, screaming out her love. But it is too late. At this point, Bronte makes a radical change in tragic moral argument: she essentially reverses heroes and gives Heathcliff the lead. Heath-cliff returns and attacks ruthlessly, as a love made in heaven must when it has been scorned for something so pedestrian. Heathcliff is a rebel who, like Achilles, is initially right in his revenge against injustice. Bronte uses the "return of the man" technique when Heathcliff comes back, Monte Cristo style, wealthy and sophisticated. The audience feels tremendous triumph in these scenes, and they don't even need to see how the character has made such a huge transformation. The man is back, finally armed as everyone has dreamed of being armed in a similar situation. The audience feels "It could be done—I could have done it," followed by "Now I will take my sweet revenge." With the audience firmly on Heathcliff's side, Bronte reverses the moral argument by having Heathcliff go too far. Even losing such a love in so unjust a manner does not allow you to marry the sister and sister-in-law of your enemies just to pay them back. To see the innocent love that Edgar's sister,`

(revelation or self- revelation) Mountain This highest of all places translates, in human terms, into the land of greatness. This is where the strong go to prove themselves—usually through seclusion, meditation, a lack of comfort, and direct confrontation with nature in the extreme. The mountaintop is the world of the natural philosopher, the great thinker who must understand the forces of nature so he can live with them and sometimes control them. Structurally, the mountain, the high place, is most associated with the reveal, the most mental of the twentytwo story structure steps (see Chapter 8, "Plot"). Revelations in stories are moments of discovery, and they are the keys to turning the plot and kicking it to a "higher," more intense level. Again, the mountain setting makes a one-to-one connection between space and person, in this case, height and insight. This one-to-one connection of space to person is found in the negative expression of the mountain as well. It is often depicted as the site of hierarchy, privilege, and tyranny, typically of an aristocrat who lords it over the common people down below. KEY POINT: The mountain is usually set in opposition to the plain. The mountain and the plain are the only two major natural settings that visually stand in contrast to one another, so storytellers often use the comparative- method to highlight the essential and opposing qualities of each. The mountain world is important in the Moses story, Greek myths of the gods on Mount Olympus, many fairy tales, The Magic Mountain, Lost Horizon, Brokeback Mountain, Batman Begins, The Snows of Kilimanjaro, A farewell to Arms, The Deer Hunter, Last of the Mohicans, Dances with Wolves, Shane, The Shining, and a number of other horror stories. Plain The flat table of the plain is wide open and accessible to all. In contrast to the jungle, which presses in, the plain is totally free. This is why, in stories, it is the place of equality, freedom, and the rights of the common man. But this freedom is not without cost and conflict. Like the surface of the ocean, the extreme flatness of the plain becomes abstract, highlighting the sense of contest or life-and-death struggle that will be played out in this arena. Negatively, the plain is often depicted as the place where the mediocre make their lives. In contrast to the few great ones living up on the moun-taintop, the many average ones live as part of a herd down below. They do not think for themselves, so they are easily led, usually in ways that are destructive to them. We see the plain depicted in most Westerns, including Shane and The Big Country, Days of Heaven, Dances with Wolves, In Cold Blood, Lost Horizon, The Snows of Kilimanjaro, A Farewell to Arms, Blood Simple, and Field of Dreams.
